Autistech Project Description

The ODK-Smart Clicker is an open  hardware/software solution designed to provide a very simple, low-cost way to generate ODK data.

This project will be usable to support a number of other related project both for the sanitation issues and other applications of the ODK.  It was initially concieved to support data colleciton in special education classrooms where teachers are too busy with other tasks to take time to fill out a form on ODK-Collect.

The Clicker is an open hardware device (initial prototype being built with arduino) that is small enough to wear around your neck, wrist, or carry in your pocket.  The device has a very simple interface, with just four buttons and an on/off switch.  The device is programmed to collect data regarding the button pushed, primarily time and location.  The buttons themselves correspond to the data that is desired to be collected.  Once data taking is complete the device sends the compiled data to an ODK server for later use.


App takes imput from bluetooth mouse. One click = Yes Two clicks = No

Records data in ODK instance directory.
